# IPStack
FreeGeoIP's new Name.
# API Documentation

## Requests

All requests have to be HTTP GET requests in the following schema:  

https://ipstack.com/ipstack_api.php?ip

## Parameters

**ip** *required* Valid IP address in IPv4 or IPv6 format. 

# No account?
It does need an access key, and an account, but since I'm not directly using the API, I can bypass it :D

# Story Time
I visisted IPStack Website, but I didn't want to register.  
I saw the look up tool in the front page and digged it up. Found this.  
Using this, you can get IP info without having to register :)
